Created a churn prediction model that leverages machine learning techniques to identify customers at risk of leaving a service or subscription. The project involves analyzing historical customer data, including usage patterns, demographics, and engagement metrics, to develop a predictive model. By classifying at-risk customers, the system enables businesses to implement targeted retention strategies, enhancing customer satisfaction and loyalty. The modelâ€™s insights can help inform marketing campaigns and resource allocation, ultimately reducing churn rates and improving overall business performance.
